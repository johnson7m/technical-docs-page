      <p>So you've finally had enough...</p>
      <p>Enough losing to you friend's Legacy Goblin deck or Modern Storm deck.</p>
      <p>Or maybe you just want to understand the game better.</p>
      <p>Whatever the reason may be you're here for one thing: <span id="bold">how to build your own deck.</span></p>
      <p>Let's Begin:</p>

        <li>A basic understanding of Magic: The Gathering rules</li>
        <li>60+ Magic:The Gathering cards (not including lands) </li>

      <p>Generally decks have a combination of 60 or of the following types of cards:
      <h3>Lands & Spells</h3>
      <p>And of course from there decks can broken down even further for example:</p>
      <div class="type-grid">
        <p>Lands</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fetches</li>
          <li>Manlands</li>
          <li>Shocklands</li>
          <li>Triomes</li>
          <li>Etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Spells</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Creatures</li>
          <li>Instants</li>
          <li>Sorceries</li>
          <li>Artifacts</li>
          <li>Enchantments</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>From there it is up to you, the player, to sift through the noise and bring about a deck of epic
        proportion!</p>
      <p>...or so they say</p>
      <p>As somenoe who has been playing magic and building their decks for over 10 years - there is only <span
          id="bold">one</span> concept you need to understand</p>
    </section>
    <section id="synergy" class="main-section">
      <header>Synergy</header>
      <h3>What is Synergy?</h3>
      <p>Synergy can be thought of as the cumulative mechanical/aesthetic interactions (positive or negative) between
        individual cards in and outside of a play structure.</p>
      <p>In ther words, two cards have very little synergy if they have no mechanical/aesthetic relevance to one
        another.</p>
      <p>Interactions can be thought of as the intended or unintended effect of a card once it is relevant to a board
        state (ie. in your hand, battlefield, library, exile, etc)</p>
      <p>In essence, the general process for understanding the overall synergy of a card goes like this:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Evaluate the card's general power level when compared to other, similar cards (similar cmcs, types,
          subtypes, color, etc).</li>
        <br>
        <li>From there identify the most interactive or strongest elements of the card and if they can be leveraged in a
          particular card strategy. For example, large creatue cards that can discard themselves like [[Troll of
          Kahza'dun]] are naturally more effective in strategies that bring creatures back from the graveyard (take
          Legacy Reanimator or Scam decks for example) </li>
        <br>
        <li>After doing some research either from your experience and own knowledge of other cards or external sources
          such as Scryfall. Sort the card into three synergy categories: High, Medium, Low.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In essence, that's all there is to synergy. Of course there are definitely more detailed and precise ways to
        factor a cards overall synergy and power-level, but for those just beginning to build their own decks, this
        methodology will go far in besting your local play group.</p>

      <p>Now, you might be wondering now, how to apply the principal of synergy to your deck-building process. Below I
        will show you the first way of implementing synergy into your deck-building by using [[precondeckname]], a
        preconstructed deck, and increasing the synergy between its cards. With the goal of increasing the power-level
        of the deck overall:</p>
      <p>The reason I chose <a class="link"
          href="https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering_Arena/Preconstructed_decks#Arcane_Aggression"
          target="_blank"><span id="italic">Charging Ahead</span> </a> is because of its simplicity. I like simplicity
        when explaining new things. I also enjoy winning by overpowering my opponent with combat strategies and large
        creatures. Additionally, precons are the entry-point for most players starting to play.</p>
